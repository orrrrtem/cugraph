def betweenness_centrality(G, k=None, normalized=True,
                           weight=None, endpoints=False, seed=None):
    """
    Compute the betweenness centrality for all nodes of the graph G. cuGraph
    does not currently support the 'endpoints' and 'weight' parameters
    as seen in the corresponding networkX call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : cuGraph.Graph
        cuGraph graph descriptor with connectivity information. The graph can
        be either directed (DiGraph) or undirected (Graph)
    k : int, optional
        Default is None.
        If k is not None, use k node samples to estimate betweenness.  Higher
        values give better approximation
    normalized : bool, optional
        Default is True.
        If true, the betweenness values are normalized by
        2/((n-1)(n-2)) for Graphs (undirected), and
        1 / ((n-1)(n-2)) for DiGraphs (directed graphs)
        where n is the number of nodes in G.
    weight : cudf.Series
        Specifies the weights to be used for each vertex.
    endpoints : bool, optional
        If true, include the endpoints in the shortest path counts
    seed : optional
        k is specified and seed is not None, use seed to initialize the random
        number generator

    Returns
    -------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
        GPU data frame containing two cudf.Series of size V: the vertex
        identifiers and the corresponding katz centrality values.

        df['vertex'] : cudf.Series
            Contains the vertex identifiers
        df['betweenness_centrality'] : cudf.Series
            Contains the betweenness centrality of vertices

    Examples
    --------
    >>> M = cudf.read_csv('datasets/karate.csv', delimiter=' ',
    >>>                   dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'], header=None)
    >>> G = cugraph.Graph()
    >>> G.from_cudf_edgelist(M, source='0', destination='1')
    >>> bc = cugraph.betweenness_centrality(G)
