    "\n",
    "As the name implies, BFS traverses the given graph in a breadth first manner. Starting at a specified vertex, the algorithms iteratively searches neighboring vertices.  \n",

    "To compute BFS in cuGraph use: __bfs(G, start_id)__\n",
    "\n",
    "* __G__: A cugraph.Graph object\n",
    "* __start_id__ : the starting vertex ID\n",
    "\n",

    "    * df[\"vertex\"]:   The vertex id.\n",
    "    * df[\"distance\"]: The distance to the starting vertex\n",
    "    * df[\"predecessor\"]: The vertex ID of the vertex that was used to reach this vertex\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## cuGraph Notice \n",
    "The current version of cuGraph has some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vertex IDs need to be 32-bit integers.\n",
    "* Vertex IDs are expected to be contiguous integers starting from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "cuGraph provides the renumber function to mitigate this problem. Input vertex IDs for the renumber function can be either 32-bit or 64-bit integers, can be non-contiguous, and can start from an arbitrary number. The renumber function maps the provided input vertex IDs to 32-bit contiguous integers starting from 0. cuGraph still requires the renumbered vertex IDs to be representable in 32-bit integers. These limitations are being addressed and will be fixed soon."
